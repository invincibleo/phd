			<p>As of 2017, I am an Ph.D. candidate at KU Leuven, Belgium. I am affiliated to the Stadius Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing, and Data Analytics (STADIUS) as well as to the e-Media Research Lab of the Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT).<br />
				In 2016, I graduated as a Master in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven, after which I spent a year as a researcher for a project called "m-Sense" hosted in the KU Leuven e-Media Research Lab. One year later, in 2017, I started a PhD research project on designing of deep learning algorithms for the acquisition and data-driven modeling of smartphone sensor data, with a particular focus on detecting user emotions and predicting mood disorders.</p>
